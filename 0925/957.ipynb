    "### 957. Prison Cells After N Days\n",
    "\n",
    "There are `8` prison cells in a row and each cell is either occupied or vacant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.\n",
    "- Otherwise, it becomes vacant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array `cells` where `cells[i] == 1` if the `ith` cell is occupied and `cells[i] == 0` if the `ith` cell is vacant, and you are given an integer n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the state of the prison after `n` days (i.e., `n` such changes described above).\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], n = 7\n",
    "Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n",
    "Explanation: The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:\n",
    "Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n",
    "Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n",
    "Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n",
    "Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n",
    "Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n",
    "Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n",
    "Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], n = 1000000000\n",
    "Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints:\n",
    "- `cells.length == 8`\n",
    "- `cells[i]` is either `0` or `1`.\n",
    "- `1 <= n <= 109`"
