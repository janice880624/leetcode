    "### 191. Number of 1 Bits\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.\n",
    "- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in **Example 3**, the input represents the signed integer. -3.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101\n",
    "Output: 31\n",
    "Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints:\n",
    "- The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`."
