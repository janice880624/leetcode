    "### 1768. Merge Strings Alternately\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the merged string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: word1 = \"abc\", word2 = \"pqr\"\n",
    "Output: \"apbqcr\"\n",
    "Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:\n",
    "word1:  a   b   c\n",
    "word2:    p   q   r\n",
    "merged: a p b q c r\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: word1 = \"ab\", word2 = \"pqrs\"\n",
    "Output: \"apbqrs\"\n",
    "Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, \"rs\" is appended to the end.\n",
    "word1:  a   b \n",
    "word2:    p   q   r   s\n",
    "merged: a p b q   r   s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: word1 = \"abcd\", word2 = \"pq\"\n",
    "Output: \"apbqcd\"\n",
    "Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, \"cd\" is appended to the end.\n",
    "word1:  a   b   c   d\n",
    "word2:    p   q \n",
    "merged: a p b q c   d\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints:\n",
    "- ``` 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100 ```\n",
    "- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters."
